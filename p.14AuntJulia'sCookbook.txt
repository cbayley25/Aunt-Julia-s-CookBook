SOME
GOOD 
RULE OF THE ROAD

TO
Remember

Don't let your car make a "machine" out of you. Be as human
under your steering wheel as walking down your street. Be as
courteous and considerate of the other driver as you would have
him be to you.

Drive on the right-hand side of the road.
Travel at a reasonable speed, use reasonable care.
Be guided by highway cautionary signs, obey traffic lights.
Interpret stop and slow signs literally and exactly.
Do not coast, keep your car under control.
When traveling in mass traffic, stay in line and move at the speed of the rest of the group.
Take passing margins from the edge of the road rather than from an oncoming car.
Overtake and pass only when there is clear vision for a long distance ahead and no opposing traffic is dangerously near.
Be especially cautious about passing oversize vehicles or unusual combinations of vehicles traveling together at approximately the same speed.
Wherever your right-of-way at intersections appears at all questionable, give way to the other car.
Be considerate of the rights of the operators of other vehicles and pedestrians.
Never drive after drinking intoxicating liquors.
Don't take THAT CHANCE, something might happen which you will regret.
