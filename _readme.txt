The MetaData I chose to record were the file names, page numbers, type of recipes, advertisements present, types of advertisements, illustration present, type of illustrations, and tip Categories.Ê The reason I chose to record the file name and page number is to match my files to the book's pages. I record the type of recipes since my book is a cookbook with various recipes, and I wanted to have some categories with the different types of food. I wanted to note if advertisements were present because my book had a mix of advertisements and recipes. I also wanted to know the different types of advertisements that showed up in the book. In the advertisements in the book, some pages included illustrations that I wanted to have the details of. Within the book, there were some tips that could be used in your daily life, such as getting stains out, which I also wanted to make note of in my metadata.

 The type of text that gives more detailed hand transcriptions is historical documents. Historical documents go through more careful cleaning because they are not easily transferable to text, as the penmanship may be different or hard to read, such as the use of cursive, or the age of the document may be hard for different technologies to pick up the text from the documents. Historical documents may also go through more careful cleaning because people may be more interested in the document as it ages. A quick and dirty OCR is not enough because if you don't spend the right amount of time on the document, the document would lose its value and not be as accessible to people who would want to use it. This then brings the question of what document deserves more time spent on it, vs. what documents should be quickly cleaned. This care usually falls in the hands of researchers who may not get paid ​​adequately enough for the time spent on their work.

The OCR/HTR was surprisingly pretty accurate; besides the pictures in my text, the words transferred nicely to my Visual Studio. When transferring the words into my text, I did very little correcting. For the text I did have to correct there were random characters that were added in my text, such as dashes and asterisks. Some errors that I faced were that I had to manually type the text from my pictures because they didn't transfer at all.
