The MetaData I chose to record were the file names, page numbers, type of recipes, advertisements present, types of advertisements, illustration present, type of illustrations, and tip Categories.Ê The reason I chose to record the file name and page number is to match my files to the book's pages. I record the type of recipes since my book is a cookbook with various recipes, and I wanted to have some categories with the different types of food. I wanted to note if advertisements were present because my book had a mix of advertisements and recipes. I also wanted to know the different types of advertisements that showed up in the book. In the advertisements in the book, some pages included illustrations that I wanted to have the details of. Within the book, there were some tips that could be used in your daily life, such as getting stains out, which I also wanted to make note of in my metadata.
