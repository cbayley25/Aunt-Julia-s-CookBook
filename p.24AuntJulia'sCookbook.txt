Simple Instructions for
Removing Common Stains

DO IT NOW, is the slogan of every
good housewife, when a stain disfigures a 
favorite fabric. All stains
are much easier to remove when they
are fresh. And stains must be removed
before washing. Check over the
directions below, and be sure that a
supply of each "remover" is kept on
hand for the emergency.
You will find these directions the
simplest and safest for common
stains. All have been tested in every m way, but because so many synthetic
fabrics and dyes are now used, there
may be times when these "recipes"
will not be en ti rely successful. If the
stain is in a very valuable piece, by
all means send it to a competent
cleaner.

BLOOD-Soak in cold water, then
wash with neutral soap and tepid
water. Or spread on cold starch paste,
allow to dry and wash.

CHEWING GUM-If the material "is washable, soften the gum stain with
-egg white and then wash. If stubborn
use Extane Spot Remover.

COFFEE OR TEA-Try hot water
first, then bleach, if necessary (moisten with 
lemon juice and expose tothe sun). A stronger bleach is sodium
hypochlorite for cottons or, for woolens
and silks, hydrogen peroxide. If
colors are apt to run, use only tepid
water followed by neutral soap and
weak ammonia.

CREAM AND MILK-Soak in hot
water, then launder with neutral soap
and warm water.

EGG-Soak linens or cottons in cold
water, rub silks with table salt, then
launder.

Fruits-Lemon and citrus fruit
juices should be sponged with clear
water and then with a weak solution
of ammonia. Treat other fruit juice
stains as directed for coffee.

or turpentine.

GRASS-Soak the stain well with
kerosene then brush out with carbon
tetrachloride, or Extane Spot Remover.

paper and sponge with Extane Spot

fuller's earth.

INK-Often difficult. Try cold
water first. If unsuccessful try turpentine,
carbon tetrachloride, alcohol,
ammonia or weak oxalic acid
over a blotter or absorbent material.

IRON RUST - Wet with lemon
juice and salt or use weak oxalic
acid.

MEDICINE, IODINE-Sponge with
clear cold water, then use alcohol or

or sponge with turpentine, carbon
tetrachloride, benzol or chloroform.

warm water and soap. Bleach as for
coffee, if necessary.

and water, turpentine or alcohol, or
Extane Spot Remover.
