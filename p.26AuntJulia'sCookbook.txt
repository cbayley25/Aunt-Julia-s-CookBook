Handy Hint on HOW TO FIX IT


BROKEN GLASSWARE- Melted
alum is better than glue for mending
glassware. It holds well and does not
show.

LOOSE CASTERS - When casters
on furniture drop out too often, remove
them, pour melted wax in the
holes and insert the casters before the
wax hardens. After it has set the casters
will not fall out again.

SCREW IN PLASTER-To make a
wood screw hold in plaster, dig out
a hole a little larger than the screw
and drive in a wooden plug. Then
drill a hole in the plug and insert the
screw.

TO DRY CHAMOIS-If you use
chamois skins to clean windows and
glassware ( and tbere is nothing better)
you have discovered that they
dry like a board. The secret is to dry
them in the wind or in front of an
electric fan. Then they'll be soft and
pliable.

OLO CLOCKS: Keep them and when
you wish to remember a certain hour
for taking medicine or other purpose,
just turn the hands of the old clock
to the hour to be remembered. This
will save you time and worry.

TO REPAIR LINOLEUM-When
lineoleum is split it can be perfectly
repaired by applying strips of adhesive
tape both ways on the wrong
side. The mended place is scarcely
noticeable, and wears indefinitely.

REPAIRING PILLOW TICKS-By
placing adhesrve tape over small
breaks or holes in pillow ticks, on the
wrong side and pressing then with
warm (not hot) iron you will h~ve an
excellent repair job.

MARKS ON FURNITURE-The
white marks made by liquids on
varnished surfaces can often be removed
if rubbed at once with a cut
lemon or a little vinegar. Then rinse
off with clear water and polish dry.
Marks made by bumps on dark polised furniture may be covered by
painting with iodine and then polishmg
with Trim Furniture Polish.

TO REMOVE WALL PAPER -
Make a solution of one tablespoon of
saltpeter to one gallon of hot water.
Apply freely to the paper with a
brush. Several applications may be
necessary, Keep the water hot.

HOLES IN PANS-Small holes in
pots or pans which are not worthy
of any expense in repairing, may be
satisfactorily fixed at home. In aluminum
utensils, hold a flat piece of
iron inside and pound around the
hole, on the outside, with a hammer.
The aluminum is soft enough to expand
and fill in a small hole. For enamel
or tin utensils, fill the hole with
putty and flatten each side like a rivet.
This repair, of course will not
stand much abuse.

TO LUBRICATE BEATERS- Glycerine
is better than oil for lubricating
egg beaters, meat cutters and
juice extractors. It is tasteless and
harmless.

TO KEEP LEATHER SOFT
Leather in shoes, traveling bags, furniture,
etc., may be kept soft by rubbing 
briskly with castor oil.  

WALL PAPER PASTE-A good
wall paper paste can be made by ift
mixing two parts water with three
parts of flour, by measure. Stir until
lumps are gone and then boil for 10
minutes, stirring well. When cool,
mix in two tablespoons of powdered
alum for each gallon of paste.

Rugs and Carpets: Grease StainsCover
stain with French chalk, placing
blotter paper over chalk and
ironing with warm iron; or sprinkle
thickly with ordinary corn starch
and cover with newspaper, let it
stand for day or two and then sweep
off.

SPOTTED MIRROR-If you have
a mirror which is' spotted and needs
resilvering, get a small can of aluminum
paint. After carefully removing
dust from the back of the mirror,
paint with a soft brush. Allow plenty
of time for it to dry before putting
back in the frame.
