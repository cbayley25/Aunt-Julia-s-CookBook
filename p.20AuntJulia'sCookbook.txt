Pressed Chicken
1 to 3 pound chicken
1 cup chopped celery
5 hard-cooked eggs
¼ teaspoon mustard
Salt and red pepper
1 tablespoon gelatin
2 tablespoons cold water

Boil the chicken gently until the meat easily falls from the bones.
Chop the chicken meat fine and add the chopped celery and the
hardcooked eggs, diced. Mix all together, adding the seasonings to
taste. Soak the gelatin in the cold water and dissolve it in the liquor
(there should be two cups) in which the chicken was cooked. Let
the broth cool and add the chicken mixture. Turn into a mold and
set upon ice or in the refrigerator to become firm.

Cut into slices and serve on lettuce leaves, with or without mayonnaise.Celery seed may be used in place of celery, but we found
that the crispness of the vegetabl9was preferrable.
